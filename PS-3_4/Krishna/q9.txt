Definition:- Consider a very small dictionary that contains 
	     the translations of English words to Dutch as
	     shown below:

english_dutch = {"last" : "laatst", "week" : "week", "the" : 
"de", "royal" : "koninklijk","festival" : "feest", "hall" :
"hal", "saw" : "zaag", "first" : "eerst", "performance" : 
"optreden","of" : "van", "a" : "een", "new" : "nieuw", 
"symphony" : "symphonie", "by" : "bij", "one" : "een",
"world" : "wereld", "leading" : "leidend", "modern" : "modern"
, "composer" : "componist","composers" : "componisten", "two"
: "twee", "shed" : "schuur", "sheds" : "schuren" }

Write a program that uses this dictionary to create a word-for-word 
translation of a sentence to be taken as an input from the user. 
A word for which you cannot find a translation, you can leave “as 
is.” The dictionary is supposed to be used case-insensitively, but 
your translation may consist of all lower-case words. It is nice if
you leave punctuation in the translation, but if you take it out, 
that is acceptable (as leaving punctuation in is quite a bit of work 
and does not really
have anything to do with dictionaries – besides, leaving punctuation 
in is much easier to do once you have learned about regular expressions).
