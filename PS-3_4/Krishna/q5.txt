Definition:- Write a Python program to create a dictionary of 
	     student data by taking input from the user,where
	     each student data contains Rollno (to be considered 
	     as key), and marks in 3 subjects (to be considered 
	     as list of values). e.g. {1 : [45, 40, 35], 2 : 
	     [41, 38, 39], 3 : [35, 30, 37]}. Prepare mark list 
	     in the following format:

	Roll No. Mark-1 Mark-2 Mark-3 Total
 	   1        45    40     35    120

students=dict()
total=0
count=0
n=int(input("How many students are there:"))
for i in range(n):
    srno=input("Enter Roll no of students")
    marks=[]
    for j in range(3):
        mark=int(input("Enter marks:"))
        marks.append(mark)
        total=sum(marks)
        students[srno]=marks,total
print("Dictionary of student created:",students)
for key,value in students.items():
    print("Roll No.",key)
    print("Mark-1",value[0][0])
    print("Mark-2",value[0][1])
    print("Mark-3",value[0][2])
    print("Total",value[1])
    print("\n")
