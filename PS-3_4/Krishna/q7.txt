Definition:- Write a Python program to create a list of
	     strings by taking input from the user and 
	     then create a dictionary containing each string
	     along with their frequencies. (e.g. if the list 
	     is [‘apple’,‘banana’, ‘fig’, ‘apple’, ‘fig’, 
	     ‘banana’, ‘grapes’, ‘fig’, ‘grapes’, ‘apple’] then 
	     output should be {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'fig': 3,
	     'grapes': 2}. 

x=[]
all_freq={}
no=int(input("enter length:"))
for i in range(int(no)):
    k=input("enter characters:")
    x.append(k)
print(x)
for i in x:
    if i in all_freq:
        all_freq[i]+=1
    else:
        all_freq[i]=1

print(str(all_freq))
