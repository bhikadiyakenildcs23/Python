Q.3. Write a Python program to create a list of numbers by taking input from the user. Split this list
into two tuples where one tuple contains odd numbers, and the other tuple contains even
numbers from the list. You can take input of non-zero numbers, with an appropriate prompt,
from the user until the user enters a zero to create the list assuming that the numbers are non-
zero.
while(True):
    inp = int(input("Enter A Number Except 0:"))
    if inp == 0:
        break
    else:
        lst.append(inp)

for i in lst:
    if i%2 == 0:
        el.append(i)
        
    else:
        ol.append(i)
        
otpl=tuple(ol)
etpl=tuple(el)
print("Odd Numbers: ",otpl)
print("Even Numbers: ",etpl)
