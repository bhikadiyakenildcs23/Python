Definition:- Consider the following list of movies. For each 
	     movie it also shows list of ratings. Write a
	     Python program to convert it in such a way that 
	     it stores all this data in one dictionary, then use
	     the dictionary to print the average rating for each 
	     movie, rounded to one decimal.

movies = ["Where Eagle’s Dare", "Enter the Dragon", "Iron Fist", "Fist of Fury"]
dare_ratings = [ 9, 10, 9.5, 8.5, 3, 7.5, 8] for the movie “Where Eagle’s Dare”
dragon_ratings = [ 10, 10, 0, 9, 1, 8, 7.5, 8, 6, 9 ] for the movie “Enter the Dragon”
fist_ratings = [ 7, 6, 5 ] for the movie “Iron Fist”
fury_ratings = [ 6, 5, 6, 6 ] for the movie “Fist of Fury”
 Output:
 Average ratings of the movie “Where Eagle’s Dare” is 7.9
 Average ratings of the movie “Enter the Dragon” is 6.9
 Average ratings of the movie “Iron Fist” is 6
 Average ratings of the movie “Fist of Fury” is 5.8
