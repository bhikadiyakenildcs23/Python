Q.1. Write a Python program to create a list of numbers by taking input from the user and then remove
the duplicates from the list. You can take input of non-zero numbers, with an appropriate
prompt, from the user until the user enters a zero to create the list assuming that the numbers
are non-zero.

ls=[]
while(True):
    inp=int(input("Enter A Number!"))
    if inp == 0:
        break
    else:
        ls.append(inp)
        
    st = set(ls)
    ls = list(st)
print(ls)
