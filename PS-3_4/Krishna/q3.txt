Definition:- Write a Python program to create a
	     list of numbers by taking input from 
	     the user. Split this list into two tuples
	     where one tuple contains odd numbers, and 
	     the other tuple contains even numbers from 
	     the list. You can take input of non-zero 
	     numbers, with an appropriate prompt,from 
	     the user until the user enters a zero to 
	     create the list assuming that the numbers 
	     are nonzero.

	Sample Input: [10, 12, 13, 90, 43, 32, 30, 11]
	Output:
 	     Tuple of Odd Numbers: (13, 43, 11)
 	     Tuple of Even Numbers: (10, 12, 90, 32, 30) 

x=[]
even=[]

i=0
while True:
    no=int(input("Enter number:"))
    if no==0:
        break
    x.append(no)

for i in x:
    if(i%2==0):
        even.append(i)
    else:
        odd.append(i)
              
event=tuple(even)
oddt=tuple(odd)
print("Even :",event)
print("Odd :",oddt)
print("list is:",x)
