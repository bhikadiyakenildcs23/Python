Definition:- Write a Python program to input a string that is
	     a list of words separated by commas. Construct
             a dictionary that contains all these words as keys
	     and their frequencies as values. Then display
             the words with their quantities.

lst=[]
d=dict()
user=input("Enter a String:")
lst=user.split(',')
print("list is:",lst)
l=len(lst)
for i in range(l):
    c=0
    for j in range(l):
        if lst[i]==lst[j]:
            c+=1
    d[lst[i]]=c
print("Dictionary is:",d)
