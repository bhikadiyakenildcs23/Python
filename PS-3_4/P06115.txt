Q.6. Write a Python program to take input of a string from the user and then create a dictionary
containing each character of the string along with their frequencies. (e.g. if the string is ‘banana’
then output should be {'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}.

std = dict()
inp = input("Enter A String:")

for i in inp:
    if i in std:
        std[i] += 1
    else:
        std[i] = 1
print(std)
