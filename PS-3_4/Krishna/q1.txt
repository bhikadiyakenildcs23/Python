Definition:- Write a Python program to create a list of 
	     numbers by taking input from the user and 
	     then remove the duplicates from the list. 
	     You can take input of non-zero numbers, with
	     an appropriate prompt, from the user until 
	     the user enters a zero to create the list 
	     assuming that the numbers are non-zero.

    Sample Input: [10, 34, 18, 10, 12, 34, 18, 20, 25, 20]
    Output: [10, 34, 18, 12, 20, 25]


x=[]
y=[]
while True:
    no=int(input("Enter number:"))
    if no==0:
        break
    x.append(no)
    for i in x:
        if i not in y:
            y.append(i)
print("list is:",y)
